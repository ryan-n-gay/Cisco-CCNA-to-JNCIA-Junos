# Cisco-CCNA-to-JNCIA-Junos

Study material for this exam can be found [here](https://bit.ly/junipergenius).

This study guide is collection of relevant information that I have gathered while going through the Juniper provided study tools. It is in no way meant to serve as a replacement to their material. Instead it is too aide in being able to look up information quickly and effectively.
